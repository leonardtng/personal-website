## ‚ùó  Disclaimer
While the website has already been deployed, the code in this repository is still in the process of optimisation, and I make regular updates to the code as often as I can. So if you would like to use any of the code but realise that it is not yet optimised, I apologise, do drop me a message and I'll work on it.

I want to keep this project open-source as a guide and inspiration to others looking for ideas for their own website. And as much as I believe in that, I would really hope that if you do adopt my code into your own project, to attribute me and give me some credit. Thank you so much!

## ‚≠ê  About this Website

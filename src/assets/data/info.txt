About: 

Not just any code. I believe in writing code with both structure and readability, and as a developer, enjoy optimising and improving the quality of the code 
that I write. I have good knowledge in front-end, back-end, as well as mobile application development, and plan to venture into the field of blockchain. 
A technology enthusiast, I am hopeful and passionate about the potential of technology in changing the world. From simple websites
to complex systems, I thoroughly enjoy the process of building software, solving complex problems, and working with others to produce amazing end-products.

NJC: 

I graduated from National Junior College in 2017 as a GCE 'A' Level Graduate from the Integrated Programme. My time here taught me to be a critical thinker and 
nurtured my penchant for problem solving. It was also NJC that gave me my first leadership opportunity as the president of the NJC Symphonic Band, where I had the 
experience of being part of a great team, and leading a great community.

Boogle:

My time at this vibrant startup has been nothing less than fruitful. It was here where I started designing and building sophisticated software from the ground up, and 
learnt much of the coding best practices and standards which I still practice heavily today. During the months I was here, I was heavily involved in the front-end
development, while occasionally finding myself immersed in the back-end and mobile development as well. I also had the opportunity to be part of an amazing product team,
which allowed me, under the guidance of brilliant mentors, to carry out the process of bringing a product through its development cycle, from the ideation, 
to the designing, coding, testing, and eventually, the deployment of the product.

Personal Website:

This website is the very first personal project I designed, built, and deployed on my own, and is also my first take on a personal website. Not only did 
building this website allow me to put my development skills to the test, it was also a great sandbox for me to explore and experiment with new development and design techniques
such as implementing different themes (try it out!), using React hooks, and being creative with scroll effects.

Yale-NUS: 

I am currently a sophomore at Yale-NUS College in the class of 2024. While I cannot be more excited, what the future holds for me here remains to be seen.

CodeCache:

My first full-stack project I designed, built and deployed during my first semester in college consisting of both a front-end and a back-end. Initially, 
this project started off as a simple idea for a site that can store my code snippets. I eventually saw this idea through to build the final product, complete 
with its own authentication system and fully functional code editor in a clean and simple UI. This project has allowed me to 
improve on both my front-end and back-end skills, as well as important development tools such as AWS EC2, Lambda, and Docker.

Dathena:
My time at this energetic deep-tech AI and data protection company was an amazing eye-opener into the technology industry. Here, I was given the opportunity to work with some
of the brightest software engineers, product managers, and data science experts I have seen so far in my professional career. I was exposed to the challenges of creating a 
complex enterprise-level product, the best practices of managing a gigantic codebase, and even got the opportunity to lead two sprints as a scrum master in the company's
agile software development workflow. While the initial onboarding was indeed challenging, overcoming this phase was certainly rewarding as I was able to contribute greatly
to their flagship product, Dathena Security, which will ship to a multitude of clients internationally. Knowing that the code I have written will positively impact a client's data
security definitely makes my few months at Dathena all the more fulfilling.

Cryptoscapes:
Cryptoscapes started out from a few skills I wanted to learn and practice over my summer break from college, the 
state management library Redux, atomic design, and project management. After tinkering with a bunch of cryptocurrency data with 
Redux, I eventually decided to create a simple UI to display this data, through the use of charts and graphs in a clean dashboard. 
This project has allowed me to improve on my front-end skills, learn useful libraries such as Redux, and implement the
atomic design file structure on top of managing the entire project with the tools provided by GitHub Projects.

What I can do:

I have been coding at a professional level for around a year and have experience in an array of modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript, React Native,
and Django REST Framework. I am also adept in using development tools such as git and AWS, and design / prototyping tools such as Invision Studio and Affinity Designer.
On the sideline, I enjoy building web applications and tinkering with the Arduino.

What I can do (note):

Note: Skills are portrayed relative to each other and not on an absolute level (learning never stops!)

Where I've Been:

Travelling greatly excites me. I love experiencing new cultures, immersing myself in breathtaking sceneries, as well as eating amazing food. I hope to one day 
fill this map with even more locations that I've visited.

Here are some snapshots I took from the places I've been recently.
